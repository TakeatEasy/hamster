/**
 * intrusive_ptr<T> is an alternative to shared_ptr<T> that has better
 * performance because it does the refcounting intrusively
 * (i.e. in a member of the object itself).
 * Your class T needs to inherit from intrusive_ptr_target to allow it to be
 * used in an intrusive_ptr<T>.
 */

// Note [Stack allocated intrusive_ptr_target safety]
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// A well known problem with std::enable_shared_from_this is that it
// allows you to create a std::shared_ptr from a stack allocated object,
// which is totally bogus because the object will die once you return
// from the stack.  In intrusive_ptr, we can detect that this has occurred,
// because we set the refcount/weakcount of objects which inherit from
// intrusive_ptr_target to zero, *unless* we can prove that the object
// was dynamically allocated (e.g., via make_intrusive).
//
// Thus, whenever you transmute a T* into a intrusive_ptr<T>, we check
// and make sure that the refcount isn't zero (or, a more subtle
// test for weak_intrusive_ptr<T>, for which the refcount may validly
// be zero, but the weak refcount better not be zero), because that
// tells us if the object was allocated by us.  If it wasn't, no
// intrusive_ptr for you!

namespace hamster {

class instructive_ptr_target {
  // Note [Weak references for intrusive refcounting]
  // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  // Here's the scheme:
  //
  //  - refcount == number of strong references to the object
  //    weakcount == number of weak references to the object,
  //      plus one more if refcount > 0
  //    An invariant: refcount > 0  =>  weakcount > 0
  //
  //  - THStorage stays live as long as there are any strong
  //    or weak pointers to it (weakcount > 0, since strong
  //    references count as a +1 to weakcount)
  //
  //  - finalizers are called and data_ptr is deallocated when refcount == 0
  //
  //  - Once refcount == 0, it can never again be > 0 (the transition
  //    from > 0 to == 0 is monotonic)
  //
  //  - When you access THStorage via a weak pointer, you must
  //    atomically increment the use count, if it is greater than 0.
  //    If it is not, you must report that the storage is dead.
  //
